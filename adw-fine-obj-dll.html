In VS2010 iterator debug level defaults to 2 in debug and is disabled in release. One of the dlls you are using probably has iterator debugging turned off in debug either because it was built in an older version of visual studio or they explicitly added the defines to the project. I've finally managed to get the triangle to show on my screen. Yay.

If you have a question that is not answered in the OP, post it in the comments. It will get answered if anyone has an answer. If the question is "Will this mod get ported/made?" the answer is #If a mod hasn't been ported yet, there is a good reason for it!

BTML runs just fine, but I cannot for the life of me get ModTek to load. I've tried clearing everything out and starting over, but it's just not loading. The ModTek.log file doesn't show any errors, but the BTML log shows an error that I don't quite understand for ModTek. Everything is up to date so I'm unsure what's going on. The error in the BTML log is as follows: Found DLL: ModTek.dll 8:30:52 PM \- ModTek.dll: Found and called entry point with void param: ModTek.Init 8:30:52 Hi! So I'm a little bit new to OS\-level programming \(most of my work has been in web and Java applications\). I have a Sainsmart 8\-ch USB relay board that is connected via USB to my Windows 10 machine. Basically I just want to be able to turn on and off the relays via Python \(using 3.6\). I tried following the directions, which suggest you can just write xFFx01x01 via pyserial to turn on the 1st relay, but this does nothing. I've confirmed the board works using the test program So I was trying to write a small wrapper lib for a dll (https://github.com/florian0/GFXFileManager) and linking to the two exported functions works perfectly fine. So my current problem is that I get a vtable from this dll and I am also able to call the given functions of it, but this is only the case when the functions I am calling do not take any parameters. If I try to call a function of the vtable that takes any amount of parameters with the needed parameters the program ends up crashing. There's a relatively easy way to get individual files from EVE, which will always be up-to-date and not require triexporter or having to download everything at once. This is a small tutorial on how to go about doing this, so that anyone who wants to look at things or maybe use them to make cool EVE fan creations is able to do so, since it can be quite a hassle to look around and try to find (usually outdated) models or textures etc. from other people: ----------------------------------- I have a new laptop, less than six months old. Intel i7, 16gb RAM, installed on SSD, Intel HD graphics 620 NVIDIA GeForce 940MX. I would think it would not have any problem running blender. But even with just the single default box, clicking on the UI sometimes takes like ten seconds for there to be a response. Dragging objects with the mouse is pretty much impossible. I checked DXDIAG and everything looks fine. Display and render tabs both say no problems found. I updated the nvidia drivers. Ok, so I have a listview. That listview is binded to a Vector of `parentClass`. Every `parentClass` has a `dataclass` inside of it, in the`data` property. The `data` property is actually of the type object, so that means I gotta cast it to `dataclass` when I bind to it. I cannot change `parentClass`. And the things inside my listview itemtemplate mostly bind to properties inside `data`. Here's some xaml illustrating this. ltlistviewgt ltlistview.itemtemplategt. I live in the UK, and am on the network 3. I just purchased the OnePlus 3, and a nano SIM to go with it. I bought a data package, and when I plugged the SIM in, the auto setup all worked except for the data, when it said I'd have to set up manually. I changed my device's APN settings according to this page ( ), but still I cannot connect. 
So I'm having a really bizarre issue today that I've never had before. The actual code is a bit conplex but it involves loading types from an assembly, some signalr and json serialization/deserialization. To simply things here's what's basically happening. I end up with an object that is of type A, let's call it obj. If I do obj.GetType() it returns type A. If I do typeof(A).Equals(obj.GetType()) it returns true. If I do (obj is A) it's false, (A)obj throws and (object as A) returns null. I'm attempting to use the Unreal LibNoise plugin by NovanMK2 (https://github.com/NovanMK2/UnrealLibNoise). It works perfectly fine in Blueprint, but I'm trying to use it in C++ now. The author says on the forum post it is designed to be used in C++.
